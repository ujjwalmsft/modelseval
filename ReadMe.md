# üìå AI Model Evaluation Platform

The **AI Model Evaluation Platform** is an advanced, structured, and scalable system explicitly designed for architects, developers, and enterprises to perform detailed evaluations of Large and Small Language Models (LLMs/SLMs). Leveraging sophisticated technologies including **Semantic Kernel (SK Python)**, **Azure AI Services (OpenAI and AI Inference)**, **Azure Cosmos DB**, and modern frontend frameworks (**Next.js and React.js**), the platform offers comprehensive and explicit comparative analyses, b...

## üéØ Use Case Scenario

This evaluation platform is particularly useful for developers and AI architects in scenarios demanding precise comparative analysis and detailed insights into model performance. It explicitly captures, analyzes, and compares LLM/SLM responses across clearly defined metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, Cosine Similarity) and qualitative scores (e.g., personalization, relevance, fluency, coherence, creativity). Results are securely stored in Azure Cosmos DB, visualized interactively, and insights are explicitly co...

## üöÄ Why Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems?

A significant advantage of the platform lies in its explicit use of **Agentic AI** combined with multi-agent orchestration facilitated by **Semantic Kernel**. Unlike traditional static methods, Agentic AI enables dynamic and contextual adaptations. Specialized agents proactively request additional context or information when initial evaluation inputs are incomplete, ensuring comprehensive and explicit evaluation results.

Additionally, this multi-agent architecture significantly enhances modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Individual agents explicitly specialize in distinct evaluation tasks, enabling streamlined development, independent troubleshooting, and rapid adaptation to evolving evaluation criteria or regulatory requirements.
